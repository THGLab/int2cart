## Installation
### Required packages
* Python (3.7.9)
* numpy (1.19.2)
* yaml (5.3.1)
* pytorch (1.8.1)
* SidechainNet (https://github.com/THGLab/sidechainnet, modified from [jonathanking's version](https://github.com/jonathanking/sidechainnet))
* pdbtools (https://github.com/JerryJohnsonLee/pdbtools, modified from [Mike Harm's version](https://github.com/harmslab/pdbtools)), only needed for using `--from_pdb` option

### Installation steps
Go to the root folder of the repository (where `setup.py` resides) and run `pip install -e .`. Make sure to switch to the target virtual environment before installation if you want to install the code in a separate environment.

## Using pretrained model
Go into the `run_scripts` folder and run with:
`python predict.py [seq] [torsion_addr] [output]`
<pre>
positional arguments:
  seq                   the one-letter amino acid sequence of the protein to
                        be predicted
  torsion_addr          the address to a numpy file that stores the backbone
                        torsion angles for the protein to be predicted.
                        Expected to be in size of Nx3, where N is the sequence
                        length, and 3 corresponds to phi, psi and omega.
  output                The output file name, excluding file extension

optional arguments:
  --from_pdb FROM_PDB   extract amino acid sequence and torsion angles from
                        the pdb file instead of providing them through
                        arguments
  --build, -b           build the structure after predicting bond lengths and
                        bond angles
  --units UNITS, -u UNITS
                        the units for angles used for inputs and outputs.
                        Should be one of [degree](default) or [radian]
  --device DEVICE, -d DEVICE
                        the device used for running the model, could be
                        [cpu](default) or [cuda:x] for GPU
  --config CONFIG, -c CONFIG
                        configuration file specifying model structure
  --model_addr MODEL_ADDR, -m MODEL_ADDR
                        a path specifying the position of trained model
</pre>                     

## Training new models
* Make sure SidechainNet package is installed and patching script (under `tools` folder have been executed)
* Prepare a yml file similar to `configs/debug.yml` and change parameters as needed
* run `run_scripts/train.py [config_file]` to train the model
